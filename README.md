# roblox-item-snipe-bot
A Roblox Item Snipe Bot. Actually working and not a scam like every YouTube video you see... 

Checks assets availability every second. 
Automatically buys items. 
All you need to do is make sure it's running and leave it be!

Updates that may or may not come. I really don't care enough:
- Auto remove items on buy

Uses CefSharp libraries (Not included in repo)

If you want to test the bot you can add a 2 robux t-shirt in the list and it will automatically buy it.
