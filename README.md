# Future Major updates
- Make bot auto buy future limited items. (Most future limited items have time restrictions in the description)

# roblox-item-snipe-bot
A Roblox Item Snipe Bot. Actually working and not a scam like every YouTube video you see... 

Checks assets availability every second. 
Automatically buys items. 
All you need to do is make sure it's running and leave it be!

Updates that may or may not come. I really don't care enough:
- Auto remove items on buy

Uses CefSharp libraries (Not included in repo)

If you want to test the bot you can add a 2 robux t-shirt in the list and it will automatically buy it.

Ban Questions
- If you are wondering if spamming the site constantly with requests will get you banned it wont. The requests are being made from a unauthorized account thus your account has no play in it at all. Requests are only made from your account when you buy the item.
